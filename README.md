- Parallel programing using MPI
- Programing language is c++
- fun projects and interesting ways to 
  increase running times of programs
  using parallel programing

**************************************************************

MPI_TimeBomb is a fun little game where a time bomb gets passed
around all the processes decrementing everytime the time bomb 
is received. Once the time one hits 0 the process that is holding
it is announced. This is a good intro as to understand how 
processes talk to each other in parallel programing.
